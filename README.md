# Features : Here is Shown 3 features of the Whole project.

There are lots of features in the project But Here I will add only three features
And the Features are
1.Home page feature
2.Donation page feature
3.Toast Feature

#Home page Feature:
In the home page feature, all data will load in the local storage and from there I 
have shown all data in home page through getItems and setItems built-in function.
So mainly user will see all Options available in the json data.

#Donation page feature:
Data from the home page I have taken only the donated data by clicking donate button
and load and set them in the same way like home page local storage functionality.
Mainly user will see all the donated data that user donated out from all json data.

#Toast feature:
This one is a great feature. When donor will click donate button it will show the user like
he successfully donated.
Toast feature give really good UX experience to the user.
